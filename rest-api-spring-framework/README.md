## Repo information
  + This repository demostrates some of the projects I worked on while self learning the spirngboot framework mostly for web service. So working with CRUD operations. Will update soon.
  + I also have another springboot project in `../backend_spbootDev`.

### The Book Tracker Mongodb.
    - Please be ready for a colourful page. At the time of working on this project, I was also learning css and javascript. Thus, the page layout is not the best!
    - Is a simple book management application that uses springboot rest api support to handle http request(CRUD operations) and  mongodb for storage.
  * To run use the commands below:
    + ./mvnw spring-boot:run
  * Once the application is ready, navigate to: http://localhost:8080/index
