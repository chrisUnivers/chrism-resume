# Repo Info
  * Factory Method design patterns from a minecraft perspective.

## To run
  * The project, currently only the biomes factory, is ran through a make file. To run simply type in the command line the following commands:
    + cd MinecraftWorld/
    + make
    + ./biomeTest
  * Currently the make file can only build one factory. Either biomeTest or foodTest.
  * The Biome Factory, in the Factory Method, works as intended.
