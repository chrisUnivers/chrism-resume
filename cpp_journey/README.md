  * This repository contains c++ code that's not apart of any school projects. It's meant to demostrate non trivial, std::vector<int> x = {1}; c++ concepts I know.
    + To see my school c++ or c projects please see:
      - `../school_projects/particleSimulator` or `school_projects/inverseKinematicsProject` or `school_projects/file_allocation_project`
    + The project `minecraft-design-ptrn` is a project that implements the factory-design pattern from a minecraft perspective. It also demostrates my OOP knowledge in c++.
    * For fundamental and non trivial algorithms see:
      + `../school_projects/more_graphs`
      + or `school_projects/linearP_solver`
