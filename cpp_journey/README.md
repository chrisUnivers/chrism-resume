## Repo info
  * This repository contains c++ code that's not apart of any school projects. It's meant to demostrate non trivial, std::vector<int> x = {1}; c++ concepts I know.
    + To see my person c++ or c projects please see:
      - `../school_projects/particleSimulator` or `school_projects/inverseKinematicsProject` or `school_projects/file_allocation_project`
    + The project `minecraft-design-ptrn` is a project which implements(in progress) the factory-design pattern from a minecraft perspective.
      - I also plan on adding the abstract factory pattern and the iterator pattern.

    + The other two repos `base_C_constructor` and `copy_constructors` are from a tuturial I followed to learn OOP in learn c++. The youtube link is provided below. The cmake file used are mine, learned from working in `c`.
      - Code for OOP concepts is mostly from using youtube tutorial such as: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvslbLHTUY&t=109s or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59fy7la7yEI

    * For fundamental and non trivial algorithms see:
      + `../school_projects/more_graphs`
      + or `school_projects/linearP_solver`

  * In my uninformed opinion, non trivial conepts I understand in c++
    + Using `smart points`:
      - shared_ptr, unique_ptr, make_unique<>, make_shared<>.
      - memory allocation using `malloc` or `calloc` and object construction using `placement new`. Or doing both with `new` keyword.
      - lambdas for non complex usage.
    + Basic understand of move semantics.
