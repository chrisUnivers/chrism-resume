## NOTES
  * This repository will contain threejs skeleton animation and inverse kinematics projects.
  * This directory contains vanilla javascript with threejs projects.
    + Reason being, projects built on top on react require external libraries, like fiber and drei. Otherwise, they're a nightmare to configure
  * The current repository is `amy-explores-vite`. The switch is to make scroll based animations easier using  `gsap`. 
  * Models used:
    + Amy: 
      - https://www.mixamo.com/#/?page=1&type=Character
    + The dances also from mixamo, however, they were combined using blender.
  * The office model is from the link below, however, the repository uses other libraries such as react three fiber and drei. This project also differs in every other way. Only the model is used.
