## Purpose
  * This folder follows the tutorial in the link below
    + https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/connectors/leverage-mongodb-data-kafka-tutorials/
  * The tutorial is a step-up from the `go` tutorial as it uses `docker` and a `source connector`.
  * See also [moreInfo](#usefull-info)

## Important
  * Remember to not add the initial git repository from the setup tutorial. Keeps things simple.

## Usefull info
  1. For simplicity, I will not include the git repository needed to run the example, link below.
    + https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/tutorials/tutorial-setup/#std-label-kafka-tutorials-docker-setup
  2. The files in here assume that the git repository from `1.` is available.
