## Project about
* The museum-project is a nextjs app that aims to demostrate my aws skills using AWS Cognito, S3 and DynamoDb.
    + Usually I would implement the backend first with express, nodejs, mongoose and more. However, that's also usually more or less the same. In this project I implement the aws side first.
    + The idea of the project is to allow artist to sign up for art showcases at a one or more museum and also for non-artists to find art shows to go to. I intend on using Cognito for user authentication, S3 for file uploads and DynamoDb as my no sql database. My other mern-app projects use mongodb or firebase.
