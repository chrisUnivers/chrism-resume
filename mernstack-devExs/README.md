## Info
  * The lunch-time project contains a mernstack project and uses redux for state management. It's inteded to allow students in high school to create clubs and join active school clubs which take place at lunch time.
    + The purpose of this project is a dream of mine. For highschool students to spend their lunch time doing math or solving puzzles for the fun of it.

  * The software-jumbo project(work in progress) is a mernstack app that allows users to browse for software. For now, it doesn't have a nice ui. The lunch-time project, however, does have a more modern ui.
    + The basic backend(the fun) functionalities works well. No but yet to be found. For now I'm using static images, however, I intend on switching to firebase-firestore(instead of mongodb) to allow for image upload, email verification and password resets. 
    + The ui is coming along but still needs some work.
