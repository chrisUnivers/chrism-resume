## Info
  * The lunch-time project contains a mernstack project and uses redux for state management. It's inteded to allow students in high school to create clubs and join active school clubs which take place at lunch time.
    + The purpose of this project is a dream of mine. For highschool students to spend their lunch time doing math or solving puzzles for the fun of it.

  * The software-jumbo project(work in progress) is a mernstack app that allows users to browse for software. For now, it doesn't have a nice ui. The lunch-time project, however, does have a more modern ui.
    + The basic backend is done. 
    + The project was initialially supposed to use mongodb as the database, however, I decide to include the functionaliity to be able to upload images. For this reason, the project now uses firestore from firebase. However, I've yet to remove mongodb.
    + The ui is coming along but still needs some work.
