## Purpose
  * This folder contains threejs my threeJs projects.
  * The purpose of skybox-explore is to simply explore an environment with a sphere.
    + I intend on making the sphere reflective.
  * The purpose of skeletal-skyboxes is to explore an environment with a skeletal figure.
    + added code samples for skeletal animation in threeJs
    + The threeJs models don't work, even when installed separately.
