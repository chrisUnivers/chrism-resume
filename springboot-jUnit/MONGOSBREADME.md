## Repo information
  + This repository demostrates some of the projects I worked on while self learning the spirngboot framework mostly for web service. So working with CRUD operations. Will update soon. 
  + I also have another springboot project in `../backend_spbootDev`. 
### The Book Tracker Mongodb.
  * At the time of working on this project, I was also learning css and javascript. Thus, the page layout is not the best. colourful page.!
