## Repo Info
  * This repo will contain my csharp projects.
  * **NetHotel project** The project NetHotel is inteded to be a donet webApi project. It will also have a database to store data and for this I will use a MS SQL Server Express LocalDB.
    + Due to time limitation, this project is on hold. Currently working on **Minecraft Design Project** which aims to demonstrate the Factory Method design pattern and maybe the iterator pattern. The iterator pattern is also used in link `../school_projects/more_graphs`.
    
    + The main features of the app will be to book hotel rooms through a web api. Once a room is booked, it will not be available to book again until the most recent booking ends.
    + Another api end point will be one that retrieves all available rooms to book.
    + 
  * **simple_linq** The simple_linq directory contains a simple mock bank class and a file that uses the select function from linq.
